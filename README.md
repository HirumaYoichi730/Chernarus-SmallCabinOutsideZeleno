DayZ Chernarus - SmallCabinOutsideZeleno.
I had this idea for a Wall around this area when I used to have a base there. However, there was no cabin then.

This has been tested on Xbox One. And hopefully this should work on PC and on PS as well.
However, if there is some errors or bugs with this file. Please feel free to email to 
hirumayoichi730@gmail.com with some screenshots.

So, the only things that are in this file is the following:

1: 15x Firewood.
2: 4x Paper.
3: 1x Land_House_1W10_Brown.
4: 1x CanOpener.
5: 1x PetrolLighter.
6: 1x TacticalGloves_Black.
7: 1x SodaCan_Kvass.
8: 1x SodaCan_Fronta.
9: 1x SodaCan_Spite.
10: 1x SodaCan_Cola.
11: 1x SodaCan_Pipsi.
12: 1x PorkCan.
13: 1x TunaCan.
14: 1x SardinesCan.
15: 1x SpaghettiCan.
16: 1x TacticalBaconCan.
17: 1x PeachesCan.
18: 1x BakedBeansCan.
19: 1x Pajka.
20: 1x Pate.
21: 1x FirefighterAxe.
22: 1x FirefighterAxe_Black.
23: 1x FirefighterAxe_Green.
24: 1x FirefighterJacket_Black.
25: 1x FirefightersPants_Black.
26: 1x StaticObj_Furniture_shelf_DZ.
27: 1x JungleBoots_Black.

So, easiest way to find this is if you go Firehouse building in Zeleno and look towards the woods over the hill across the street.
And if you are coming from Bop(Bor) then just keep going towards Zeleno. Follow the road till you see a cabin to the left side
of the road with a small shed across the road. Just keep follow the road straight and you will then be able to see the barn where
the cabin is next to. 

How to install this file to your server:
Go to your Custom folder for your server, upload the file.
Then go to your cfggameplay.json file, go to "objectSpawnersArr": [ and type in "./custom/SmallCabinOutsideZeleno.json"
and if you have more custom files then add an , after ...json" like this -> "./custom/SmallCabinOutsideZeleno.json", "./custom/anotherfile.json" .
After that just save the changes and then restart the server and if all is done right then your server has a new base area.

Thank you for reading this text.
I hope you like this store.
